                                <p class="spacetext">Description: This time we approach to the topic of the racism through words against to Brazilian people from the past. A twist that is strong and strikes you through the power of words. NIKE values and Olympics have a thing in common, which is RESPECT and FRIENDSHIP, both are our main focus in the campaign. Hand in hand with Nike + Olympics, we are able to raise an awareness effectively about racism so that people see it in a different perspective and to take a step on racism; to be united in the cultured diversity of Brazil.</p>
                                <p class="spacetext">#ASTEPFORWARD</p>
                                <p class="spacetext">The idea is to play with the metaphor that you are stepping on racism. People will be part of the campaign by once stepping on the racist words, shockingly, those words start to disappear. Its a way that them as well stepped on racism and erased those racist words. The placed message is invisible to human eye, but it is visible to cameras; through this technology, its a way to show people that racism is there, but they tend to neglect it, once your part of it, you see it, feel it. Through it, they will understand that they took a step forward to anti-racism, to raise the awareness of it, the use of the #astepforward.</p>
                                <p class="spacetext">This campaign will take part in the Olympics stadiums, and the words will be placed on the streets of Brazil.</p>
